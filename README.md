# Title of the Project: Underwater Sea-grass Classification Using Deep Learning Techniques

## Prerequisties:
Install the following python libraries
- Python 3.10
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Tensorflow
- Sci-kit Learn
> Now, you're ready to go!

## Description: 

- Identification of seagrass with bare eyes is really difficult, hence, this work proposed a deep learning
model which incorporates transfer learning method- Inception V3.
– The dataset is collected from CSIRO, Australia database which consists of training data: 80% - 42848
images and test data: 20% - 8566 images. Firstly, implemented Inception V3 model which has 42 layers.
Secondly, implemented efficientnet B7 which has 813 layers (accuracy increases by increasing the no.
of epochs). Finally, implemented convnet 5 layers and at final layer added ’l2’ regularizer. Activation
function: ’softmax’ for all 3 models.
– Respectively, before augmentation and after augmentation – the inception V3 model gives 98.2% ac-
curacy and 97.4% accuracy, the efficientnet B7 model gives 36% accuracy and 45% accuarcy and the
covnet gives 92.7% accuracy and 80% accuracy
- It's a simple web form which has been developed using HTML5.
